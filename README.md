This is my first look and experiments with SCSS and its features.

This a simple landing page of fictional tour trip company. It has a title screen, different tour options, testimonials, a form to book, a footer and a navigation button. Note that all of these features have no real functionality, the goal in this project was to simply play around with CSS.
